# kobu-csv-processor-example

[Kobu](https://github.com/kobuscript/kobu-interpreter) is a domain-specific programming language for constructing 
source code generators.

This example processes all CSV files in the "in" folder, and for each one generates an HTML file in the "out" folder, 
containing a graphical chart. The script also generates an index.html file.
